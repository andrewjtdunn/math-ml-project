## Project Summary
Using 8 years of data from the City of Austin's Animal Center, we predict the outcomes of cats held at the Center. A multinomial logistic regression gradient descent model predicts the 6 possible outcomes with about 50% accuracy. Notably, we code the model "by hand", using only matrix multiplication in numpy. The model can be improved further with more feature engineering and refined oversampling.

## Project Report
We describe our complete approach and results in a [summary report](https://github.com/andrewjtdunn/math-ml-project/blob/main/project_summary.pdf) and document our process in a [notebook](https://github.com/andrewjtdunn/math-ml-project/blob/main/code/multinomial%20logistic%20regression.ipynb).
